# Digital Geography Lab Data Library

Over the years, the Digital Geography Lab (DGL) has collected data from a variety of open data sources, that now reside in the group’s common database. These data collection efforts have been carried out by different members of the DGL and different contributors, at different points in time, and with different focus and coverage. This is especially true for data from social media, data from other online platforms, and volunteered geographic information. 

This document is an effort in honouring everybody who contributed to the DGL data library, and to keep record of which datasets have once been used in DGL research and publications. It also should serve as a document to cite when referring to data that are re-used in a new study. For these purposes, please use the following citation:
